# ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation & Setup

Currently, only [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows) is supported (as Valorant does not support other OSes).

- **Add an exception for .exe files.**
- **Follow the steps below (main installation).**
- **Add an exception for the folder with Valorant AutoTracker.**
